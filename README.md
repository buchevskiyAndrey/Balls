This is quite small SpireKit project. It is the game for iPad 9.7-inch, where the player can drop balls on the bouncers and they will bounce, but if they touch one of the good or bad slots the balls will be destroyed. However, balls face obstacles placed between the top of the scene and the slots at the bottom, so that players have to position their balls exactly correctly to bounce off things in the right ways.
